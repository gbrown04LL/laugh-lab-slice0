THE CONTEST
Written by Larry David

INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jerry is sitting on the couch reading a magazine. George bursts through the door, looking distressed.

GEORGE
You're not going to believe what happened to me.

JERRY
What?

GEORGE
My mother caught me.

JERRY
Caught you? Doing what?

GEORGE
You know... (makes a gesture)

JERRY
(laughing) She caught you?

GEORGE
I was in my room. I thought she was at the store. She came home early. Jerry, she collapsed. She saw me and she collapsed!

JERRY
How is she?

GEORGE
She's in the hospital. They're running tests. It's all my fault, Jerry. I can't believe this is happening.

Kramer enters.

KRAMER
Hey, what's going on?

JERRY
George's mother caught him.

KRAMER
Caught him? (realizes) Oh! (laughs) That's beautiful!

GEORGE
It's not beautiful! She's in the hospital!

KRAMER
So what are you gonna do?

GEORGE
I'm never doing it again. I'm stopping. Cold turkey.

JERRY
You think you can do that?

GEORGE
I have to. Look what happened!

Elaine enters.

ELAINE
Hey guys. What's up?

JERRY
George is taking a vow of abstinence.

ELAINE
Really? From what?

GEORGE
From... you know.

ELAINE
Oh. (pauses) I could do that.

JERRY
You?

ELAINE
Sure. Why not?

KRAMER
I could do that too. Easy.

JERRY
Oh, please. You guys couldn't last a week.

GEORGE
What about you, Jerry? Could you do it?

JERRY
Me? Of course I could do it. I'm the master of my domain.

KRAMER
Master of your domain?

JERRY
That's right.

GEORGE
I'm the master of my domain.

ELAINE
I'm the master of my domain.

KRAMER
I'm the king of the county!

JERRY
Okay, so we're all masters of our domain. Let's make it interesting. A contest.

GEORGE
What kind of contest?

JERRY
Whoever can go the longest... wins.

ELAINE
Wins what?

JERRY
How about... a hundred dollars each?

GEORGE
I'm in.

KRAMER
I'm in.

ELAINE
Wait, I'm a woman. I should have a advantage.

JERRY
What kind of advantage?

ELAINE
I don't know. Women are different.

KRAMER
No advantage. We're all equal here.

ELAINE
Fine. I'm in.

They all shake hands.

JERRY
May the best man win.

ELAINE
Or woman.
